Versions of this program:
=========================

I deliver 2 modifications of Version 2.6. Both have the same features. The difference is the maximum number of observed aircraft and the memory consumption.

adsbscope27_256.exe
===================
This version can monitor up to 256 aircraft. It needs only 50 kByte of memory and is a little bit faster then the other version


adsbscope27_16384.exe
=====================
This version can monitor up to 16384 aircraft. It needs 500 kByte of memory and is a little bit slower then the other version





Directories

/extra

This files contain the outlines of the states of the world. Missing files can be downloaded from the internet by adsbScope.


/html
=====

/osm
=====
The software buffers all downloaded open-streat-map-data in this directory. If an osm-map has to be generated, then data is downloaded only,
if it is not contained in this directory. 


/srtm
=====
The software buffers all downloaded srtm-data (topographic map) in this directory. If an srtm-map has to be generated, then data is downloaded only,
if it is not contained in this directory. 


/save
======
The user can save a combination of position, zoom and osm-map. Each sve generates two files in this directory. The *.pos-File contains 
position and zoom, while the *.jpg-file contains the related osm-map. The save-files with the name default.* are loaded by the software 
during program start.  The other files can be loaded manually.
Size and position of the program window is saved too.


/ssb1
======
In this directory the software looks for 
- runway-information in files with names like "*_apt.out".
- ILS-information in files with names like "*_ilst.out".
- air-route-information in files with names like "*_atc.out".

Such files can be downloaded from  www.jetvision.de.
Go to http://jetvision.de/sbs.shtml and download the *.zip-file for your region. Extract the *.out-files from this zip-file, 
and copy them into the ssb1 subdirectory.
All *_apt.out, *_ats.out and *_ils.out files are loaded by the software during program start.

For future use ist the file radarsites.txt, it is a copy of http://jetvision.de/gm/list.php
